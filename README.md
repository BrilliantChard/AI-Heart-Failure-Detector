# 🫀 AI Heart Failure Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Heart Failure Detection System** is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on clinical records. It is built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 📊 **Heart Failure Prediction** using Random Forest Classifier  
- 🧾 **Manual Input** or **CSV Upload** for predictions  
- 📈 **Data Analysis Visualizations** (correlation matrix, class balance)  
- ✅ **Model Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- 💡 Educational disclaimer for responsible usage

## 📊 Example Dataset Features

| Feature              | Description                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Age                 | Patient's age                          |
| Ejection Fraction   | Blood pumping capacity (%)             |
| Serum Creatinine    | Kidney function level                  |
| High Blood Pressure | Binary indicator                       |
| Smoking             | Binary indicator                       |
| Heart Failure        | Target variable (1 = at risk, 0 = not at risk)  |

## 📦 Output

- **Risk Status:** `At Risk` or `Not at Risk`
- **Probability Score:** e.g., 85% likelihood of heart failure

---

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC
