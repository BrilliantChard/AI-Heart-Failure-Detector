# 🫀 AI Heart Failure Detection System

## 📖 Project Overview

The **AI Heart Failure Detection System** is a machine learning-based solution aimed at predicting the risk of heart failure in patients. Using either real-time sensor data or pre-collected datasets, this system trains a classification model to detect early signs of heart failure and alerts healthcare professionals or uploads results to the cloud for further analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze sensor data or historical health records.
- Train a classification model to predict heart failure risk.
- Automatically send analysis results to doctors or to a cloud platform for remote monitoring.

## 🧠 AI Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.
2. **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, encoding.
3. **Model Training:** Use classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.
4. **Prediction:** Determine risk of heart failure based on input data.
5. **Communication:** Send results to doctors or sync with cloud storage.

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas, numpy
- **Web API:** FastAPI or Flask
- **Cloud Services:** Firebase, AWS, or GCP
- **Visualization:** Streamlit
